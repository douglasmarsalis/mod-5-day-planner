# mod-5-day-planner

## Description

First item - As a web developer, I want to be able to schedule important tasks throughout my day using a day planner. This day planner is able to show current, future and past color slots for me to easily see and schedule my tasks.
Second item - I will make sure the code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
Third item - By building this webpage, it also helped me to learn inforamtion on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, README markdown information, and Deployment. Also, the usage of JQUERY third party APIs.

## Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
